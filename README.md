Driver Drowsiness Detection with OpenCV & Dlib

In this project, we are going to build a driver drowsiness detection system that will detect if the eyes of the driver are close for too long and infer if the driver is sleepy or inactive.

This can be an important safety implementation as studies suggest that accidents due to drivers getting drowsy or sleepy account for around 20% of all accidents and on certain long journey roads it’s up to 50%. It is a serious issue and most people that have driven for long hours at night can relate to the fact that fatigue and slight brief state of unconsciousness can happen to anyone and everyone.

There has been an increase in safety systems in cars & other vehicles and many are now mandatory in vehicles, but all of them cannot help if a driver falls asleep behind the wheel even for a brief moment. Hence that is what we are gonna build today – Driver Drowsiness Detection System

conda create -n env_rtdds 
conda activate env_rtdds
conda install -c conda-forge dlib 
conda deactivate 
```

## Running the system: 
1.Install all the system requirments by:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2.fter the system has been setup. Run the command: 
python app1.py

3.Open your browser and in the search bar type: 
<b>localhost:8000</b>
